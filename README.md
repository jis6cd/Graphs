# Graphs
This was an assignment done in the Program and Data Representation course at UVA. I was responsible for writing the algorithms that would traverse the graphs - the rest of the code was provided for us in an effort to make the assignment shorter.

I wrote, tagged, and commented part of the deoxygen document. I also wrote an algorithm to solve the traveling sales man problem - note that this algorithm was applied to a small number of nodes in the graph. After writing the algorithm, I was tasked with making the algorithm run more efficiently. 

These algorithms traverse Middle Earth.
